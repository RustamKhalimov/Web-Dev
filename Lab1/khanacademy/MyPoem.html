    <h1>A Whispered Dream</h1>
    <p>Beneath the sky so wide, so blue,<br>  
The stars lean down to speak to you.  <br> 
A gentle breeze begins to play,  <br> 
And carries all your fears away.  <br> 

The moonlight dances on the stream,  <br> 
Awakening a quiet dream.  <br> 
In every shadow, thereâ€™s a spark,  <br> 
A guiding light within the dark.  <br> 

So hold your heart, so soft, so true,  <br> 
The world is brighter because of you. <br>
