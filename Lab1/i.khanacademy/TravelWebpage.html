        <h2>Info about mountains</h2>
        <p class = "mountains-info">Mountains are natural elevations of the Earth's surface that rise prominently above their surroundings. They are typically formed through geological processes such as tectonic activity, volcanic eruptions, and erosion.</p>
        <h2>Type`s of mountains</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Tectonic Mountains</strong>: Formed when Earth's tectonic plates collide, causing the crust to fold and rise (e.g., the Himalayas).</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Mountains</strong>: Created by volcanic activity, as magma rises and solidifies (e.g., Mount <em>Fuji</em> in Japan).</li>
            <li><strong>Erosional Mountains</strong>: Formed by weathering and erosion wearing down surrounding rock, leaving harder materials (e.g., the Catskills in the U.S.).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Famous Mountains</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mount Everest</strong> (8,849 m): The highest peak in the world, located in the Himalayas.</li>
            <li><strong>K2</strong> (8,611 m): The second-highest peak, known for its challenging climbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Denali</strong> (6,190 m): The tallest mountain in North America, in Alaska.</li>
            <li><strong>Mount Kilimanjaro</strong> (5,895 m): A dormant volcanic mountain in Tanzania, Africa.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Around 25%</strong> of the <em>Earth's land</em> area is mountainous.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Andes</strong> in <em>South America</em> is the longest mountain range, stretching over 7,000 km.</li>
            <li><strong>The Rocky Mountains</strong> in 
            <em>North America</em> are home to many national parks.</li>
